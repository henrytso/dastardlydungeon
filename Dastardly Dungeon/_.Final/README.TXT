 DIRECTIONS

    You are a brave adventurer, sent to purify the corrupt Dastardly Dungeon. 
    
        You will begin on the top floor, and move deeper as you level up. There are
    three floors in total. Only travel down a staircase if you are certain you can handle
    the upcoming challenge.

    Monsters will only chase you if you walk near them.
